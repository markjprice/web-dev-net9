# How to switch from .NET 9 to .NET 10

After [downloading](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) and installing .NET 10.0 SDK, follow the step-by-step instructions in the book and they should work as expected since the project file will automatically reference .NET 10.0 as the target framework. 

## Upgrading the target framework for a project

To upgrade a project in the GitHub repository from .NET 9.0 to .NET 10.0 often only requires a target framework change in your project file.

Change this:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
```

To this:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
```

> **Warning!** Sometimes it is better to recreate a project because the project template and APIs may have changed and only changing the target framework is not enough. This is especially true for third-party project templates like Umbraco CMS.

## Upgrading packages for a project

For projects that reference additional NuGet packages, use the latest NuGet package version instead of the version given in the book. For example, you might reference a package, as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference
    Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder"
    Version="9.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

To use .NET 10 Preview 1 packages, search https://www.nuget.org for the package and find its latest preview version number. For example, for [Preview 1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder/10.0.0-preview.1.25080.5), as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference
    Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder"
    Version="10.0.0-preview.1.25080.5" />
</ItemGroup>
```

To always use latest .NET 10 preview, release candidate, or patch version package, use a version number wildcard, as shown in the following markup:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference
    Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder"
    Version="10.0-*" />
</ItemGroup>
```

> You can search for the correct NuGet package version numbers yourself at the following link: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder#versions-body-tab.
